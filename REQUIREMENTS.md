Distributed Document Search Service
Overview
Design and implement a prototype of a distributed document search service capable of searching
through millions of documents with sub-second response times. This service should demonstrate
enterprise-grade architectural patterns including multi-tenancy, fault tolerance, and horizontal
scalability.
Time Expectation
3-4 hours (with AI tool assistance encouraged)
Scenario
Your company needs a document search service that can:
• Handle 10+ million documents across multiple tenants
• Support full-text search with relevance ranking
• Return results in under 500ms for 95th percentile queries
• Handle 1000+ concurrent searches per second
• Provide tenant isolation and security
• Scale horizontally as document volume grows
Deliverables
1. Architecture Design Document
Provide a concise architecture document (2-3 pages max) that includes:
• High-level system architecture diagram showing all major components
• Data flow diagram for indexing and search operations
• Database/storage strategy (explain your choice of search engine, database, cache layers)
• API design with key endpoints and contract examples
• Consistency model and trade-offs
• Caching strategy across different layers
• Message queue usage for asynchronous operations
• Multi-tenancy approach and data isolation strategy
2. Working Prototype
Implement a simplified but functional prototype that demonstrates:
• REST API with at least these endpoints:
o POST /documents - Index a new document
o GET /search?q={query}&tenant={tenantId} - Search documents
o GET /documents/{id} - Retrieve document details
o DELETE /documents/{id} - Remove a document
• Basic multi-tenant support (can be header-based or path-based)
• Search functionality (can use Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL FTS, or any search solution)
• Simple caching layer (Redis, in-memory, etc.)
• Basic rate limiting per tenant
• Health check endpoint with dependency status
Technology Choices: Use any language/framework you're comfortable with. Docker-compose
setup is encouraged for multi-service architecture.
3. Production Readiness Analysis
Document what would be required to make this production-ready:
• Scalability: How would you handle 100x growth in documents and traffic?
• Resilience: Circuit breakers, retry strategies, failover mechanisms
• Security: Authentication/authorization strategy, encryption at rest/transit, API security
• Observability: Metrics, logging, distributed tracing strategy
• Performance: Database optimization, index management, query optimization strategies
• Operations: Deployment strategy, zero-downtime updates, backup/recovery
• SLA Considerations: How to achieve 99.95% availability
4. Enterprise Experience Showcase
Provide brief examples (1-2 paragraphs each) from your experience on:
• A similar distributed system you've built and its scale/impact
• A performance optimization that resulted in significant improvements
• A critical production incident you resolved in a distributed system
• An architectural decision you made that balanced competing concerns
Evaluation Criteria
We will assess your submission based on:
• Architectural Thinking: Quality of design decisions and trade-off analysis
• Code Quality: Clean, modular, testable code with proper error handling
• Scalability Awareness: Understanding of distributed systems challenges
• Security Mindset: Proper handling of multi-tenancy and security concerns
• Production Maturity: Realistic assessment of production requirements
• Communication: Clear documentation and reasoning
Submission Guidelines
1. Use AI Tools: You are encouraged to use GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, or any
other AI tools.
2. Code Repository: Provide a GitHub repository with:
o Source code with clear README
o Docker-compose file (if applicable)
o Sample API requests (Postman collection or curl commands)
o Architecture diagrams (can be simple markdown/ASCII diagrams)
3. Documentation: Single PDF or Markdown file containing:
o Architecture design
o Production readiness analysis
o Experience showcase
o Brief note on AI tool usage
Bonus Points
• Implementing advanced search features (fuzzy search, faceted search, highlighting)
• Demonstrating blue-green deployment strategy
• Including performance benchmarks from your prototype
• Showing cost optimization strategies for cloud deployment
• Contributing to relevant open source projects (provide links)
Notes
• Focus on demonstrating architectural thinking over complete implementation
• The prototype should be functional but doesn't need production-level polish
• Mock external dependencies where appropriate to save time
• Document assumptions clearly
